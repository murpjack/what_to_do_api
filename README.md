# WhatToDo API (and DB)

This is a part of a product which helps a user to decide how they should spend a few hours.
The best days out with friends (or a date) include three things:
- Food (which includes drink) 
- An experience
- Good conversation  

This API supports two applications.
1. The social-user application will to begin with, display a _single_ place to eat or drink, something to do and an interesting fact. 
2. There will be a parallel application using this same API that allows local businesses to list themselves and provide information about their venue, such as whether they are pushchair friendly, or cater for people with dietary requirements.

This product is built without a particular city/location in mind, with the intention it would be easy to re-implement in different locations.
